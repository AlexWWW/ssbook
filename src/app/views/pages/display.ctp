<h2>Why use SharpBetTracker?</h2>
<p>SharpBetTracker makes your life easier. How? By doing things for you, things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking down your bets to show you which bets you are best at and which ones you are ... not so good at. Ever wondered if betting away favorites really is a money burner like a lot of people say? Check for yourself! Maybe you'll find that you're smart enough to choose away favorites that WIN.</li>
<li>Grading your wagers for you. Have you ever had so many wagers going in a day that it took a ton of work to figure out if you were up or down at the end of the day? Or have you ever had a crummy day and just not wanted to even look at your records, much less enter in your losses? Well, we've got you covered - we'll grade your games for you, show you your record for the day, and how much you're up. You'll spend less time record-keeping and more time winning.</li>
<li>Giving you detailed analysis on your portfolio, like
<ul>
<li>What-if analysis: Want to see how your portfolio would look like if you had flat bet everything instead of varying your wager amounts? Our what-if analysis tool will allow you to do just that, showing you the best way to deal with your bankroll to help you earn more.</li>
<li>Rollover calculators: Ever lost track of how much rollover you have left at a sportsbook? We'll keep track of that for you, so that way you know when that bonus money you received is yours. Plus, this way you don't have to worry about a sportsbook "rounding up" your rollover.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Helping you through losing streaks - when you can look back on your records and history in the middle of a losing streak, it makes those inevitable losing streaks much more bearable. When you can see how well you've done in the past, it'll help you resist chasing your losses or making those long-shot parlays that end up costing you more money.</li>
<li>Increasing your credibility - When you can back up your plays with solid statistics about your record, your credibility will increase 100-fold. We even provide attractive ways to show a mini-version of your customized statistics page along with your bets, to make your forum posts stand out from everybody else's, instantly increasing people's respect for you.</li>
