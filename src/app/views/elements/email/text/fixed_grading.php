Hi y'all

As I'm sure everyone has noticed, we've been having problems with game grading over the past week. We think we've fixed the problem now, and you should see all games graded properly. If this isn't the case, please email me at edmund@sharpbettracker.com with what games / bets you're experiencing the problem on.

So sorry for the inconvenience this has caused y'all! Thank you so much for bearing with us and for using sharpbettracker!

Sincerely,

Edmund Lee
